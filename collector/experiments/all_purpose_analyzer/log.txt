* Import normals analyzer.
* Add features to support multiple events (up to four).
* Fix R script.
* Finish off python script error handling.

Friday 19th of Jan 2018:
* Weird numbers in the results were a result of precise_ip == 3. Once removed,
  everything works smoothly.


Sunday 21st of Jan 2018:
* What the script can do:
	1. Accept options (also has a reasonable help option).
	2. Set environment variables.
	3. Find out if analyzer was terminated properly or not.

  What features I wish to add to the script:
	1. Make a folder with instructions on how to use the data.
	2. Decide what to do with the corrupt data.
	3. Accept option to check program (the one being analyzed) return value.
	4. Add options for sampling (only a few select possibilities).
  What analyzer can do:
	1. Accept options in the form of environment variables.
	2. Set up to 3 events.
	3. Make buffer on instruction fd.
	4. Get call_chain samples and print them in desired file.
	5. No longer weird numbers.
	6. Returns proper errors.

  Questions to consider:
	1. Do we wish to set errors as an environment variable?
	  With this method, we eliminate the need for child-parent communication
	  and allows us to check the to be analyzed program's return value on its
	  own.
	2. Complete variation testing and see which method is better.
	3. Should we have precise_ip == 3 or 0? The former lead to more precise
	  call chains but weird numbers in the inst_counter, the latter to less
	  precise call chains but no weird numbers. callchain.txt is an example
	  of both.
	4. Can we prove ingens results considering slow downs with analyzer?

  What features I wish to add to analyzer:
	1. Function addresses. Understand why Lex's code does not work.
	  Once I can find out which function is which, I will be able to use the
	  call chain.


  FOLDERS:
	1. insthrasher_test: Is a file with modified branch miss prediction
	  thrasher suited for testing with analyzer script testing.
	  miss.csv is with branch misses and nomiss.csv is without branchmisses.
	  There is a noticeable but rather small difference in the two tests
	  that prove the results in the original instruction_thrasher folder.
